**Description:** Asks for confirmation before opening links
 Asks before a link is (accidentally) opened in a browser. Links are opened in
 x-www-browser.
 .
 Currently only the Tor Browser starter from the tb-starter package (by Whonix
 developers) supports using open-link-confirmation. Shell wrappers could be
 written to support other browsers as well.
 .
 On an Anonymity Gateway (when the anon-gw-base-files package is installed), it
 honors the $EDITOR environment variable (falls back to kwrite if unset), asks
 if a file should be opened in an editor before opening it and informs, that
 opening links on a Gateway is unsupported for security reasons.
 .
 This package is produced independently of, and carries no guarantee from,
 The Tor Project.
