**Description:** APT Sources List for Security-Focussed Linux Distributions
 A question of distribution maintenance strategies. The more standard
 way would indeed be populating /etc/apt/sources.list at install or build time
 and leaving /etc/apt/sources.list.d alone. The idea of managing
 /etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian.list for the user is, the security-focused
 distribution maintainers can decide when it is a better "change stable to
 oldstable", "keep wheezy as long as needed to work out [eventual!] issues
 that would break during upgrade to jessie" and such.
